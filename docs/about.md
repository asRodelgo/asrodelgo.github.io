# ✨ How it Works?

High quality information, such as the **frequent**, **granular**, and **low-latency** data routinely collected by the private sector, can facilitate more informed public sector decision making. But without efficient global markets for private sector data, these data are difficult to access.

To overcome this barrier, the **Development Data Partnership** facilitates collaboration between firms and international development organizations for the efficient and responsible use of private sector data for public good.

The Partnership has been able to build a foundation for sustained collaboration, which includes:

- **LEGAL FOUNDATION**
 Template data license agreements and MOUs between international organizations saves time and resources.
- **DATA MARKETPLACE**
 A web-based proposal management portal facilitates seamless interactions between Data and Development Partners.
- **SHARED SECURE IT ARCHITECTURE**
 Centralized IT architecture and processes for ingesting, storing, and pre-processing data, as well as for coding collaboration, lower costs and facilitate secure data use.
- **DATA GOODS**
 Accessible code repositories for derived data products and algorithms broaden Partnership impact.
- **DATA GOVERNANCE**
 A robust data governance system guides best practices for responsible and ethical data use.

Partnership activities are guided by a Board, with representation from each international development partner, as well as a Strategic Advisory Group, with representation from donors and technology partners. Day-to-day management is led by the Partnership’s Secretariat and working groups – legal, IT, and data science. These governance bodies – and the invaluable contributions of their members – make possible our seamless coordination between international organizations and private firms for public good.
