# 🏛️  Proposals

 **We are excited to see your project come to life as part of the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org)** and have prepared this manual to walk you through the process of using the *Marketplace*.

## Development Data Partnership Portal

The [Development Data Partnership **Portal**](https://portal.datapartnership.org) is a web-based proposal management portal that facilitates seamless interactions between Data and Development Partners.

Development Data Partnership Portal
```

The [**Partnership** Portal](https://portal.datapartnership.org) is the platform through which Development Partner(s) submit and Data Partner(s) receive and evaluate requests for data and/or services and is available to staff members of participating organizations through single sign-on (SSO) via the World Bank.

Through the **Portal**, staff can:

1. Discover data and/or services alongside documentation
2. Access Proposals (from the community)
3. Submit Proposals
4. Review Proposals
5. Accept Terms & Conditions

When a staff member identifies third-party data and/or services that can benefit their project, they can submit a data request - a [Proposal](#proposal) - for review by Data Partner(s).

```{tip}
The *Development Data Partnership* team is dedicated to helping you find the best available data opportunities. Please reach out to us if you have any questions or could not find what you are looking for.
```

Upon evaluation, the Data Partner(s) will inform their verdict, either supporting or not supporting the new use case. If approved, the Data Partner(s) will grant access to the requested data under the *Partnership*'s custody.

## Proposal

The **Proposal** contains information about the scope, objective, geographical and temporal extent, methodology and team members working on a project and is appended - behind the curtains - to the previously *signed* **Master Data License Agreement**.

This mechanism is a crucial component that enables
new use cases to leverage the existing data licensing and ensures the quick turnaround in receiving data and/or services from Data Partner(s) through [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org)

###  Proposal Lifecycle

Once submitted, the **Proposal** changes status according to the diagram below. The status informs the stage of a proposal.

The following are the necessary steps to submit a data request for review by Data Partner(s).

#### 1. Authenticate with the Portal

The [**Partnership** Portal](https://datapartnership.org) is available to staff of participating organizatings via single sign-on (SSO) using your institutional credentials (via the World Bank). Note that, when signing in, first you will be presented with the World Bank login page and sequentially be redirected to your organization's login page when you enter your work email to sign in.

The platform is where you request and where **Data Partners** review and approve (or reject) data requests (Proposals).

#### 2. Fill out and submit the Proposal Form

Fill out the [**Proposal** data form](https://portal.datapartnership.org/submitproposal) with required fields either by entering text (e.g., title) or by selecting items on the dropdown menus (e.g., datasets) to request data and/or services from Data Partner(s).

Data Proposal Form
```

```{important}
Please note that **all** team members must be included on the **Proposal**. Otherwise, you will be in violation of the **Master Data License Agreement**. If necessary, new team members can be added posterior.
```

In addition, it is recommended to provide as much detailed information about your project's objectives and methodology as possible, to increase the chances the new use case approved, including:

- Project Objective
- Geographical Region
- Method Employed
- Key Tasks Involved

```{caution}
Currently, there is **no** functionality to save the proposal as **draft**. Please make sure to submit the proposal before the session expires (~20 minutes).
```

#### 3. Look out for Questions or Updates

In some cases, **Data Partners** will have follow-up questions and need further clarifications. Please keep an eye open for any communication from **Data Partners** or from the **Partnership**.

```{tip}
It is recommended provide as much detailed information about your project's objectives and methodology as possible. Data Partner(s) may need to better understand the requirements, not only to encourage responsabile data use, but ensure data quality.
```

#### 4. Review Important Data License Terms and Conditions

Upon approval, the **Proposal** status will move to **Pending Agreement to Terms**. All team members will then receive a notification requesting for their confirmation and ability to comply to the Terms & Conditions.

```{note}
A summary of the Terms & Conditions can be found on both the [**Partnership** Portal](https://portal.datapartnership.org) and [**Partnership** Documentation](https://docs.datapartnership.org).
```
